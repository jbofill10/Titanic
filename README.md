# Titanic
My "Hello World" into Data Science in Python. I used the Kaggle Titanic data set to do some cool ML stuff.

Data set used: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

# Interesting Findings

This graph displays the Sex Distribution of the passengers onboard.

This graph shows who died and survived from each sex respectively.

I find it very interesting that even though there were more males on board, a larger proportion of them died compared to women.
This leads me to believe that the men gave women/children priority of the life boats over themselves.
