# Titanic
My "Hello World" into Data Science in Python. I used the Kaggle Titanic data set to do some cool ML stuff.

Data set used: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

# Interesting Findings

This graph displays the Sex Distribution of the passengers onboard.

These graphs show who died and survived from each sex respectively.

I find it very interesting that even though there were more males on board, a larger proportion of them died compared to women.
This leads me to believe that the men gave women/children priority of the life boats over themselves.

These next graphs show the surviorship of each of the Pclasses respectively. Pclass 1 was supposed to be the most expensive one, then Pclass 2, and then 3.

The people in Pclass 1 survived the most, probably due to better positioning on the boat.. then Pclass2 was about even. Pclass 3 was not the place to be it seems. I don't know if this still holds true back in the days of the Titanic, but usually the "cheaper" tickets lead to rooms near the bottom of the boat. That would probably explain why so many Pclass 3 voyagers died.

Not too shocking. The trends mentioned before regarding Pclass survivorship and gender seem to play a big part in whether you survived or not. 

These graphs show the Female survivorship of the respective Pclasses.

I wonder why so little women died in Pclass 2 but a considerable amount more died in Pclass 3. I expected more women to die in Pclass 3, but I didn't expect the margin between Pclass 2 and Pclass 3 to be so high.
